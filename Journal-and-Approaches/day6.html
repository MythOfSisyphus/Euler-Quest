            <h2>Thoughts:</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoyed working on this problem. I'm very eager to write about it yet I'm wondering
                "how would I explain all the approaches?" I've just finished writing its python code.
                Let's see what happens, we will start with scratch and end up with most optimized approach
                for this problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you reshape given triangle as right angled triangle, you will realize that adjacent numbers of any element
                $a[i][j]$ are $a[i+1][j]$ and $a[i+1][j+1]$ where $i$ and $j$ denote the row and column number respectively.
            </p>

            <h2>Approach 1: Explore Every Path</h2>
            <p>
                Yeah, you read it right. Exploring every path is very costly and has exponential time complexity.
                Even after knowing all these complications, we're going to write its code using <i>breadth-first search</i>
                as it is important and will be helpful in future problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                While writing this I am very confused and thinking, "what to explain? how to explain?" because for me this approach
                is as intutive as adding two digits. See, we will start exploring path from first number after that explore both of its
                adjacent numbers and keep repeating this step. Have a look at the following code and try to do follow it step by step for
                any triangle you want.
